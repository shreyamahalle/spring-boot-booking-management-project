# **spring-booking-management-project**

Welcome to the Spring Booking Management Project, a simple yet powerful Java application that simulates a booking management system. This project is built using the
Spring Framework (XML-based configuration only) and applies solid Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

> **Use case**: A food ordering platform where customers can register, explore nearby restaurants, place orders, and get deliveries from available agents based on location and serviceability.

## Introduction

## Project Overview

The Spring Booking Management System provides a modular approach to managing:

 - Customers
 - Restaurants
 - Delivery Agents
 - Orders

It mimics real-world operations like customer registration, restaurant assignment, order placing, and delivery
tracking — all managed using a clean layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository).

## Features

## Key Features

-  Customer and Restaurant Booking Management: Effortlessly handle customer bookings and restaurant data.
-  Delivery Agent Simulation: Assign delivery agents based on location and availability.
-  Dynamic Order Handling: Add, track, and manage orders through their entire lifecycle.
-  Seamless Java Integration: Clean integration of Java models for each entity (Customer, Delivery Agent, Order,
  Restaurant).
-  Easy-to-Follow Structure: Well-documented, clean code for learning and demonstration.
-  Layered Architecture: Clean separation of concerns.

## Getting Started

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 21**: Install the latest JDK for optimal performance.
- **Maven**: Make sure Maven is installed to handle the project build.
- **MySQL Database**: You'll need to have MySQL installed and set up to manage your data.
- **Apache Tomcat**: A servlet container for running your web application.
- **IDE**: Use IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any Java IDE you're comfortable with.
- **Git (optional)**: For version control and easier collaboration.

## Steps to Get Started

## 1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:shreyamahalle/spring-boot-booking-management-project.git
```

## 2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

```bash
 cd spring-boot-booking-management-project
```

## 3. **Open the Project in Your Preferred IDE:**

```bash

 Launch your IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc.), and open the cloned repository.
```

## 4. **Set up the MySQL Database:**

```bash
  CREATE DATABASE booking_management;
  USE booking_management;
```

## 5. **MySQL Database Setup**

- To set up the database and create the necessary tables, run the following SQL queries:
  ```bash
  -Insert sample data into the Customer table
   INSERT INTO Customer (name, username, mobileNo, city, area)
  
  -VALUES ('John Doe', 'johndoe123', '123-456-7890', 'New York', 'Manhattan');
  ```

## 6. **Configure Your MySQL Connection:**

- In your project configuration (application.properties), set the MySQL database connection details.

- Example application.properties:

- spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/booking_management
- spring.datasource.username=root
- spring.datasource.password=your_password
- spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

## 7. **Compile and Run the Application:**

- Locate Main.java in your IDE.

- Run the file to launch the application.

## 8. **Build the project:**

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

## Module Responsibilities

- **Customer**: Handles user registration, city/area resolution, and personalization.
- **Restaurant**: CRUD operations and geo-based filtering logic.
- **Order**: Links Customers to Restaurants; encapsulates logistics and contact info.
- **Delivery Agent**: Assignments and delivery lifecycle management.
  
## Spring Annotations

- Overview of Spring Annotations
  In this project, Spring annotations replace XML-based configuration for defining beans, enabling easier configuration
  and management of the application. The following annotations are used:

1. @Configuration
   Description: Marks the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context. This is used in place of
   XML configuration files.

2. @ComponentScan
   Description: Tells Spring to scan the specified base package(s) for annotated components (like @Service, @Controller,
   @Repository, etc.) and register them as beans in the Spring context.

3. @Service
   Description: Indicates that a class is a service, which typically holds business logic. It's a specialization of
   @Component.

4. @Repository
   Description: Marks a class as a Data Access Object (DAO), typically used for database-related operations. It also
   provides exception translation.

5. @Controller
   Description: Marks a class as a Spring MVC controller, handling incoming HTTP requests.
6. @Autowired
   Description: Automatically injects the dependencies into the Spring beans. It can be used on fields, constructors, or
   setter methods.
7. @Bean
   Description: Used to define a bean within a @Configuration annotated class. It's a method-level annotation.

```
## Best Practices Followed
- MVC Layering: Each layer has a single responsibility and adheres to open/closed principle.
- Exception Handling: Extendable @ControllerAdvice class can be added for custom error management.
- Validation: javax.validation annotations (future improvement) to enforce domain constraints.
- DTO Mapping: DTOs can be introduced for request/response abstraction (optional enhancement).
- Lombok: Reduces boilerplate while maintaining readability.

## Future Scope
- Add unit tests using JUnit + Mockito
- API authentication using Spring Security or JWT
- Integration with Kafka or RabbitMQ for event-driven order tracking
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Dockerization and deployment to Kubernetes or AWS ECS
